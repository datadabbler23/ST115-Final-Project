Main Research Question
We would like to explore the LSE offered accommodation halls via the LSE Accommodation website; parsing through specific statistics, we would like to reach the goal of being able to offer students a more concise and specific way of looking at housing options in the aspects of hall location, room type, rental price, hall facilities etc. before their actual arrival in London.

The main question we would be trying to answer is “Which hall is the best for me?”. We would aim to provide this answer by extracting information on various things from the website and putting them in readable and visual formats; whether that be in tables, graphs, etc.
